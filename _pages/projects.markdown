I wanted to design my very own online forum. It uses Django, PostgreSQL, and vanilla JavaScript. I gave it a retro design to reflect its old-school nature but I also made sure it was responsive and able to work on mobile devices. No longer live.

This is a remake of Sony's *LocoRoco*. It uses Lua and LOVE2d. Our game uses `.svg` files for the levels, so anyone can make their own level.

An interdisciplinary project. I wrote a Python library to compile my notebook and planner page designs into PostScript files that print crisply on my home printer. Next, I'm learning bookbinding techniques to bind the paper together into a custom planner. In progress.
