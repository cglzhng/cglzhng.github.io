title: You are squat and covered in beige stucco

You are squat and covered in beige stucco, even the balconies. I haven’t been inside you for years, but I can still picture it clearly. Your dingy carpets and the smoke stains on your walls, bedbugs and ants invading every one of your surfaces, your parking lot contaminated with urine. My family lived in you when I was ten, when my dad quit his job as a janitor to manage you. We lasted all of three months. We swore we’d never return to you, even if you paid well. My dad went back to school to become an accountant.

Ten years later, I’m in your neighbourhood again. My dad bought a house here. It’s new and shiny, completely different from you. Every day, on my routine walk, I make a short trip to see you, crossing the four-lane road to get from the rich side to the poor side.

I admit, it took a while for me to recognize you at first. I’d forgotten about you. Three months is a long time for a kid, but not for an adult. I had too many deadlines and appointments to think about you. Do you remember me? 

Of course you don’t. You are just a building. But I remember me. I remember me liking you. The way sunlight glowed off your recently-waxed wood floors, even if they were only waxed because our bedbug pesticide destroyed them, and the way your ants were so small and dense they formed solid, red, swirling and writhing lines, even if those lines pointed directly at my cereal.

Most of all, I liked that you were right next to the park and library, even if your tenants followed me and my dad every time we walked there. 

Now that I’m here again, I’ve taken the time to revisit all of these places around you. The park, the library, the community centre, the pizza shop, the corner store. This neighbourhood is full of ghosts. Did you know that?

Of course you knew that. My dad once saw a ghost in you. He told me a frightening story about an old woman walking around your hallways at three in the morning, who kept ignoring him and didn’t know how to use the elevator. So you already know all about ghosts.

The ghosts I’m seeing are a different kind, though. They’re ten-year-old girls who look suspiciously like me. One is at the little corner store eyeing musk-flavoured Mentos while her dad bought cigarettes. One is at the park with her friend. They’re looking at a wanted poster together. “It says he’s a rapist,” her friend says. Another is at the library looking up the words “musk” and “rape” in a dictionary, wondering if the man in the poster lives inside you. Another is pulling weeds out of the grass and sticking them in her mouth, pretending they’re stalks of wheat. Another is walking back to you with her dad after missing dance class.

One of them is always on the swings, her favourite spot in the park, while her dad is off smoking in the distance. She appreciates that her dad tries to keep the smoke away from her but wishes he’d just quit instead. That’s what she thinks about as she swings higher and higher, pumping her legs as hard as she can, trying to reach something. The gigantic pink-orange clouds? The rare pale moon that wavers in the evening sky? 

“It will never be today again,” she reasons to herself between thrusts on the swing. “Yesterday happened, and it’s over—and it isn’t yesterday today.” I wonder if the place she’s trying to get to is yesterday. But the only place she can go is inside you, so I follow her and her dad as they go back to you, both reluctant.

I can’t follow them past your doors, so I can only guess at what she’s feeling. It would be easy to say she’s afraid to go to you because of the horrible beasts that you house. The bedbugs and the ants and the other tenants. But she thinks they’re fine, really, those are adult fears, that’s what her mom and dad are afraid of. Even with all the beasts, she likes you, because you keep her warm, and safe, and hold all her belongings. No, I think she is afraid because inside you, when she is done reading all of her books and practicing her piano, somehow, she must put everything down and tomorrow must become today.

I turn away from you and begin making the trip back, to cross the four-lane road into the rich side of town, to go back to my own house and its shiny and new interior. There will be no beasts, and yet I am still afraid.
